It would make sense to first create a database in which we would store various information, that way we can then
run code that can add to and take from that database.


## Airport
 - How many runways would the airport have
 - How many destinations would it be possible to travel to from our airport
 - Where is our airport located
 - What are the prices for the flights
 - How can we allow customers to sell their tickets
 

## Passenger

- How do we plan to make sure the data is persistent, when a passenger buys a ticket
we must be able to store their data

- We could use SQL to create our own database
- This database could contain tables that represent the info gathered from the user
- We should create a relational database
- The use of primary and foreign keys would allow us to retrieve info from different tables
- How much luggage are they able to take with them?

## Aeroplane

- How would we ensure the aeroplane has enough fuel to make a journey
- If for an unfortunate reason our plane crashed, how would we make sure we are still able to fly other passengers
- What is our plane model, what is it's capacity

## User Stories
- I want to be able to create a passenger list with name and passport number, so that I can add them to flight
- As an airport assistant I want to be able to create flight trip with specific destination
- I want to be able to assign and or change my plane to my flight trip, input my password so I can handle the problem
- I want to be able to add passengers to flight trip so I can sell tickets to them
- I want to be able to generate a flight attendees list report that lists of passengers name and passports, so that I can check their identity document


## Database Connectivity
- create_connection file in which we will be able to create persistant data
- Being able to efficiently add and remove to the database on demand
- Being able to link the data stored in table through the usage of primary and foreign keys
